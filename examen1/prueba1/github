AFAIK you can't ask apt for what are their current sources, however you can do what you want using shell tools.

Getting a list of repositories:

grep -h ^deb /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* >> current.repos.list

Applying the list:

apt-add-repository << current.repos.list

Regarding getting repo from a package (installed or available), this will do the trick

apt-cache policy package_name |grep -m1 http| awk '{ print $2 " " $3 }'

However, that will show you the repository of the latest version available of that package, you may have more repositories for the same package with older versions. Remove all the grep/awk stuff if you want to see the full list.
